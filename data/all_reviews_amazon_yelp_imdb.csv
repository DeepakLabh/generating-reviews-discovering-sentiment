1408,I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.,0
1409,There are neutral colors for those that prefer something not so obvious.,2
1410,If you are in a somewhat rural area as I am you might want to consider something other than the Cyclops.,2

1416,I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.,0
1417,Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.,0
1418,Timely shipment and quality product.,1
1419,I have gone through two of these phones.,2
1420,Then they told me it doesn't happen.,2
1421,Nice solid keyboard.,1
1422,"I can walk about 30 feet away from the phone, and still be able to talk.",2
1423,Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.,1
1424,I do a bit of remote PC support and liked the idea of utilizing a hands-free bluetooth set that I could sync with my Motorola Razr.,2
1425,I find myself having to hit the keys with my fingernails.,2
1426,Great product - installation was easy - the only problem was that I had to use alcohol to remove sticker residue from both inner and outer guards.,2
1427,We own a towing business and he is on his phone ALOT.,2
1428,Horrible phone.,0
1429,The reason this rating is low is because this wasn't the item I needed.,2
1430,I have been through 3 cases so far and either they're too bulky or too flimsy but this case offers protection without bulking up the phone.,2
1431,Here's why:1.,2
1432,BT50 battery junk!.,0
1433,"Now that I've grown up a bit, I've gone thru another 5 or 6 Bluetooths and this was probably the bottom of the line for all of them.",2

1456,The included earpieces did not offer an option that felt secure to the ear either.,2
1457,Great software for Motorolas.,1
1458,It broke quite soon.,2
1459,I bought the RDX-150 because the description said for PC and Mac!,2
1460,I unplugged it from the charger and plugged it in again several times and finally got it to turn on.,2
1461,The delivery was on time.,1
1462,Who wants to talk on the phone while they're riding anyways?,2
1463,Very easy to use.,1

1467,I really wanted a case to protect the screen and didn't want to use a stick-on protector because of past bad luck with them.,2
1468,If you are a man then this is not the phone for you.,2
1469,Can go all day without charging for the most part -- and I use my phone a lot!,2
1470,Not as good as I had hoped.. This was the exact item I had been looking for and could not find in the stores where I was shopping.,2
1471,Using it for a headset is great also but the mic is too sensitive.,2
1472,Worked.. I'm always dropping the phone and its great too cover up the window on the phone too.,2
1473,"As it turns out, the ""flex"" arm is really just a piece of metal surrounded by a plastic sheath.",2
1474,"They also said, ""We don't support Blackberry.""",2

1476,Ordered this for my white iPhone.,2

1478,"I have bought about 10 of them, and the reason I need so many is that I am super hard on them.",2
1479,"In some ways, it is kind of offensive.",2
1480,"At least they reversed the charge because I had two months free trial!10/30/04 -- As an update, I have now had the phone for almost a year.",2
1481,"It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.",1
1482,"So if you've just pressed 9 different digits, you have to sit there and hold clear for ten seconds before you can utilize the volume control.",2
1483,I'd like to return it.,0
1484,So I ran to Sprint to replace it and the V3 caught my eye.,2
1485,"you fulfilled so very many of my childhood aspirations, especially my dream of becoming a rogue international spy.",2
1486,The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.,1
1487,10 cent for text message/free to recieve.,2

1490,"Blinking red indicates a missed call, message waiting or no signal.",2
1491,"Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.",0
1492,"After charging overnight, these batteries work great.",1

1495,I love this phone!.,1
1496,I don't even get service in my own apartment with T-mobile and I am trapped in a contract with them until July 08.,2

1506,pretty d*mn good.,2
1507,Not great but better than most.,2

1509,"great phone, when bought through cingular.",2
1510,"If you have small ears that don't stick out from your head, then this might not be the one for you.",2
1511,it is a smaller phone but i expected that when i got it.,2

1514,"Having owned two of the Body Glove Earglove Headsets, I would not purchase another one.",2
1515,"I don't know if this happens with all phones, just mine.",2
1516,its always one thing after another.,2
1517,And it allows me to take important calls and make them while I am driving without breaking the law and with safety in mind.,2
1518,I wish it were a little smaller around my ear - the only reason I gave it 4 stars.,2
1519,Works very well with ASUS EP 121 Slate.,2
1520,"The customer service for Cingular is the same as other companies I have tried, Sprint and Verizon.",2
1521,Slight scratches on it.,2
1522,"Nice fit, no range.",2
1523,So I returned it.,2

1525,it's.... the carrying case is ok.,2
1526,!Muhammad Ali Hasan,2
1527,The calendar and reminders are useful4.,2
1528,"Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.",0
1529,I'm soo organized!.,2
1530,"I've used several different headsets over time, and none beats the Plantronics!",2
1531,"However, there's quite some stupid designs in there.",2
1532,This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.,0
1533,This PDA rocks.,1
1534,"It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.",1
1535,"I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!",1
1536,I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.,1
1537,The same amount I am getting on an original equipment two and one half year old battery.,2
1538,Thats kinda important.,2
1539,It's a thicker material so I found it easier to apply and it went on without any bubbles on my first try.,2
1540,Pretty piece of junk.,0
1541,It is not compatable with my son's 8gb 4th gen ipod nano.,2
1542,"I understand that a later firmware release fixes this, which Jabra can install if you ship it back to them.",2
1543,"Unfortunately, I donated it to charity once I got this phone so I can't use it.",2
1544,Plug was the wrong size.,0

1556,"For $3.08 including shipping, I can't complain.",2
1557,Defective crap.,0
1558,I would go with a name brand product and pay more for better quality.,2

1594,The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.,1
1595,It's been one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had with a piece of technology.The construction and comfort of this headset are fine.,2
1596,So I got one (also from Plantronics) that cost a little more and it works great.,2
1597,I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.,1
1598,Makes it a little hard to be discreet in a meeting.,2
1599,I use in 18 wheller.,2
1600,"very good product, well made.",1
1601,Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.,1
1602,The result is that it turns itself off frequently during a call cutting off the speaker for a second or two.,2
1603,I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.,1
1604,Have been using it for 4 weeks and it is broken already.,2

1612,The screen is a bit washed out in high light.3.,2
1613,I hope I save one poor soul from this phone.,2
1614,The Sony Ericsson battery lasted for about 12 hours and then I'd have to charge it.This phone fit the bill perfectly.,2
1615,I didn't give it 5 stars because customer service with cingular needs so much improvement.,2
1616,I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.,0
1617,The clarity is unequal to any cellular phone on the Market.,2
1618,*Charging is slow.,2

1635,so go on ahead and buy it.,2
1636,this is not a phone.,2
1637,I burned through 2 sheets just trying to apply them.,2
1638,No real improvement.,0
1639,Razr Battery - Good buy.,1
1640,We had a lot of experience with older types of permanent magnet windgenerators and spruce (wood) blades.,2

1647,Have been using it for a few months and have no problems at all.,2
1648,Don't buy this if you want to use the clip.,2
1649,And Palm's desktop software can surprise you with a feature that automatically deletes most of your old calendar entries.,2
1650,A case MADE for the Razr.,2
1651,I've been using this charger for my Sprint Centro 690 for the past 6 months after my Palm charger died.,2
1652,"I use the headset on my way to work, on my way home and when I'm out and about on weekends - about 4 hours a day; and I have yet to charge it.",2
1653,They refuse to refund or replace.,0
1654,It is also very flimsy.,2
1655,I have purchased 4.,2
1656,Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.,0
1657,So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.,0
1658,Great case and price!,1
1659,"finally, i decided to get this phone.",2
1660,The A210 is paired by means of a stylus pressing down a depressed switch on the body of the unit.,2
1661,"The price from Amazon was well below retail and the unit has a sleek, polished look.",2
1662,All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.,0
1663,I never got it.. The seller says they did not get paid and Amazon say they paid them on the 15th of May and its the 31st.,2
1664,"BUT...The eargels unclip too easily when in a pocket, bag, or ESPECIALLY when in the pocket-clip charger.",2
1665,Could be better.,2
1666,I ordered this charger from BargainCell and received it in 3 days as advertised.,2
1667,"Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.",1
1668,I am constantly complimented on it and people are always curious about it.,2
1669,"Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.",1
1670,I purchased the carrying to reduce the wear and tear not to mention help keep me from loosing my 2nd H700 bluetooth headset.,2
1671,The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.,1
1672,Motorola v551.,2
1673,none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.,0
1674,I strap the Sirius SL-100 to my upper arm and hit the weights.,2
1675,I am glad I purchased it.,1
1676,I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.,0
1677,I have adjusted it a number of times to the highest setting and it is about half the volume of other bluetooth ear pieces I have.,2
1678,"Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.",0
1679,No more holding the button down just the right way for just the right length of time to turn it on!,2

1686,I exchanged it for a Sanyo PM8200 and its much better.,2
1687,Sometimes the device would actually be off (which it did on its it own) and I would have to turn it on.,2
1688,"No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.",1
1689,But I will grant the possibility that it was simply a defective charger.,2
1690,"When it is replaced onto the headset, the plastic breaks.",2
1691,I even upgraded the firmware on the headset...no change that I could tell...,2
1692,I will review the phone and then review the MP3 player's problems and good points.THE PHONE:My previous phone was a Motorola V330 -- the blue one.,2
1693,Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset.,2
1694,The only issues,2
1695,Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.,0
1696,If you are a teenager this phone may be good for you.,2
1697,I put my old battery back in my phone.,2
1698,Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.,0
1699,"Both worked fine with either phone, even recognized the voice commands stored on both phones.",2
1700,The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.,0
1701,"I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.",1
1702,"After using this headset even the bass on my car speakers is enough to bother me now, and they're just normal car speakers.",2
1703,No documentation or any other information was included.,2
1704,I bought this exact same item from someone a few months ago.,2
1705,"As of now, I can call manually and receive calls but heaven forbid it goes into voicemail.",2
1706,"I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.",1
1707,Could have been Better!.,2
1708,Thank you for such great service.,1
1709,That left a bad taste in regards to amazon.,2
1710,The item came quickly and it was exactly what I wanted and in the time I needed.,2
1711,Its a total package.,1
1712,I wasn't able to find the web site for the manufacturer.,2
1713,"The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.",1
1714,I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.,0
1715,There is a longer painstaking way to do it.,2
1716,hopefully before i retired,2
1717,It's AGGRAVATING!,0
1718,Not worth the price in my opinion.,2
1719,"The service is very reliable now that Cingular has spent money on over 47,000 cell sites in America.",2
1720,I'm a technically savvy person but I can tell I'm in for hours of valuable time trying to get this to work.,2
1721,I just hope they fix the bugs.,2
1722,Great product for the price!.,1
1723,Why show this one?,2
1724,I was embarrassed when they took it out of the box for a first look.,2
1725,"I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use",1
1726,Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!,1
1727,"None of it works, just don't buy it.",0
1728,"The scam is that if you run all of the cable and mount everything, you will not want to remove everything for return.",2
1729,I know i sould stuck up but it is true.,2
1730,They replaced the infuriating proprietary NOKIA POP-PORT combination USB and HEADPHONE access port with separate STANDARD USB and HEADPHONE jacks.,2
1731,"Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.",0
1732,"The holes don't match up perfectly, but it's good enough.",2
1733,"I'm very active, so I want a headset that I can use to listen to tunes while working out or running.",2
1734,Most of the time people can't hear me.,2
1735,I was fooled twice.,2
1736,I used the original HS820 for years which was a great headset.,2
1737,Please dont waste your money.,0
1738,My interior is a bit noisy but it seems to work great in quiet rooms but not really anywhere else.,2
1739,Sound quality is always pretty bad and I get complaints from the other side also.I have a Platronics since before I got this and that works great.,2
1740,"I believe that it is common sense that when you have a phone of this build, you obviously must be a lot more careful and aware with it.",2
1741,"This comes with a bunch of phone adapters, but not a micro usb, the most common for cell phones so I actually haven't been able to use it yet,",2

2939,"Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  ",0
2940,"Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  ",0
2941,Very little music or anything to speak of.  ,0
2942,The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  ,1
2943,"The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  ",0
2944,Wasted two hours.  ,0
2945,"Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  ",1
2946,A bit predictable.  ,0

2948,And those baby owls were adorable.  ,1
2949,"The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  ",1
2950,The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  ,1
2951,It Was So Cool.  ,1
2952,"This is a very ""right on case"" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  ",1
2953,"It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  ",0
2954,"This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  ",1
2955,"I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  ",1
2956,"It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.  ",1
2957,""" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  ",1
2958,I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  ,1
2959,"In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  ",1
2960,How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  ,1
2961,"It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  ",1
2962,"Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  ",1
2963,This short film certainly pulls no punches.  ,0
2964,Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  ,0
2965,This is the number one best TH game in the series.  ,1
2966,It deserves strong love.  ,1
2967,It is an insane game.  ,1
2968,"There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  ",1
2969,Waste your money on this game.  ,1
2970,This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  ,1

2972,Today the graphics are crap.  ,0
2973,"As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  ",1
2974,This game rocks.  ,1
2975,"Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  ",1
2976,It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  ,1
2977,This was a flick doomed from its conception.  ,0
2978,"The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  ",0
2979,I wasn't the least bit interested.  ,0
2980,"Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  ",0
2981,But it's just not funny.  ,0
2982,But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  ,0
2983,"His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  ",0
2984,The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  ,0
2985,"The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  ",0
2986,"But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  ",0
2987,"The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  ",1
2988,"I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  ",1
2989,"In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  ",1
2990,It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  ,1
2991,"On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  ",0
2992,"Long, whiny and pointless.  ",0
2993,"But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  ",0
2994,"Excellent cast, story line, performances.  ",1
2995,Totally believable.  ,1
2996,Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  ,1
2997,Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  ,1
2998,I sat riveted to the TV screen.  ,1
2999,All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  ,1
3000,I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  ,1
3001,I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  ,1
3002,I was very disappointed in the movie.  ,0
3003,One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  ,0
3004,There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  ,0
3005,There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  ,0
3006,This movie totally grates on my nerves.  ,0
3007,"The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  ",0
3008,"And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  ",0
3009,"Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  ",0
3010,"It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  ",0
3011,There are some generally great things in it.  ,1
3012,"I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  ",0
3013,"The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  ",1
3014,"I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  ",1
3015,"If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  ",1
3016,Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  ,1
3017,"He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  ",1
3018,"I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained ""movie business"" of Québec.  ",0
3019,This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  ,1
3020,"If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  ",1
3021,"Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  ",1
3022,"Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  ",1
3023,Give this one a look.  ,1
3024,I gave it a 10  ,1
3025,The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  ,1
3026,It is a true classic.  ,1
3027,It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  ,1
3028,Definitely worth checking out.  ,1
3029,The problem was the script.  ,0
3030,It was horrendous.  ,0
3031,There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  ,0
3032,The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  ,0
3033,MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  ,1
3034,The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  ,1
3035,The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  ,1
3036,Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  ,1
3037,"If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of ""The Way You Look Tonight""), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  ",1
3038,I don't think you will be disappointed.  ,1
3039,"Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  ",0
3040,"The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  ",0
3041,"It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  ",0
3042,Too politically correct.  ,0
3043,Very disappointing.  ,0
3044,"The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  ",1
3045,"I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  ",0
3046,An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  ,0
3047,But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  ,1
3048,"The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  ",1
3049,The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  ,0
3050,"The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  ",0
3051,"), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  ",0
3052,The directing seems too pretentious.  ,0
3053,"The scenes with the ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  ",0
3054,And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  ,0
3055,"Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  ",0
3056,"Some applause should be given to the ""prelude"" however.  ",1
3057,I really liked that.  ,1
3058,A great film by a great director.  ,1
3059,The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  ,1
3060,The music in the film is really nice too.  ,1
3061,I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  ,1
3062,Brilliant!  ,1
3063,10/10  ,1
3064,I liked this movie way too much.  ,1
3065,My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  ,0
3066,It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  ,1
3067,"However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  ",0
3068,"There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  ",0
3069,There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  ,0
3070,"This was a poor remake of ""My Best Friends Wedding"".  ",0
3071,"All in all, a great disappointment.  ",0
3072,"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".  ",0
3073,I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  ,0
3074,I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  ,0
3075,"IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  ",0
3076,"I saw ""Mirrormask"" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  ",0
3077,"Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  ",0
3078,"These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  ",0
3079,All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  ,0
3080,"It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  ",0
3081,"You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  ",0
3082,This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  ,1
3083,"This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  ",0
3084,The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  ,0
3085,"A truly, truly bad film.  ",0
3086,"The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  ",0
3087,The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  ,0
3088,I paid too much.  ,0
3089,"Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  ",1
3090,It was so BORING!  ,0
3091,No plot whatsoever!  ,0
3092,"Again, no plot at all.  ",0
3093,Horrible!  ,0
3094,Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  ,0
3095,I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  ,0
3096,I hate movies like that.  ,0
3097,"Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  ",0
3098,THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  ,0
3099,"If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  ",0
3100,Awful.  ,0
3101,I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  ,0
3102,It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  ,0
3103,NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  ,0
3104,"This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  ",0
3105,"Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  ",0
3106,"Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  ",1
3107,Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  ,0
3108,I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  ,0
3109,This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  ,0
3110,I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  ,0
3111,I mean this in a terrible way.  ,0
3112,This film has no redeeming features.  ,0

3116,The script iswas there a script?  ,0
3117,The kids are annoying.  ,0
3118,The lead man is charisma-free.  ,0
3119,"Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  ",0
3120,I'll even say it again  this is torture.  ,0
3121,Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  ,0
3122,Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  ,0
3123,Highly unrecommended.  ,0
3124,"If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  ",0
3125,"Yes, it's that bad.  ",0

3128,"Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  ",1
3129,It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  ,1
3130,"This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  ",0
3131,There were too many close ups.  ,0
3132,But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  ,0
3133,But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  ,0
3134,"""You'll love it!  ",1
3135,This movie is BAD.  ,0
3136,So bad.  ,0
3137,The film is way too long.  ,0
3138,This is definitely one of the bad ones.  ,0
3139,The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  ,1
3140,John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  ,1
3141,His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  ,1
3142,I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  ,1
3143,I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  ,0
3144,I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  ,0
3145,"It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  ",0
3146,"Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  ",0
3147,Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  ,1
3148,His performance is simply genius.  ,1
3149,"He owns the film, just as Spacek owned ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and Quaid owned ""Great Balls of Fire.  ",1

3151,Ray Charles is legendary.  ,1
3152,"Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  ",1
3153,Hitchcock is a great director.  ,1
3154,Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  ,0
3155,"Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  ",1
3156,It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  ,0
3157,Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  ,0
3158,"The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  ",0
3159,There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  ,0
3160,Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  ,0
3161,"This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  ",0
3162,The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  ,0

3166,"When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  ",1
3167,"I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  ",1
3168,"However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  ",0
3169,"I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  ",0

3173,It was just too horrible.  ,0
3174,"The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  ",0
3175,But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  ,0
3176,The poor actors.  ,0
3177,You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  ,0
3178,If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  ,0
3179,This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  ,0
3180,"If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  ",1
3181,"The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  ",1
3182,"Regrettably, the film fails.  ",0
3183,"The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  ",0

3199,"***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  ",1
3200,The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  ,1

3209,Up there with the best of Melville.  ,1
3210,Everything about this film is simply incredible.  ,1
3211,You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  ,1
3212,BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  ,1
3213,"The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  ",1
3214,I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  ,1
3215,I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  ,0

3235,And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  ,1
3236,"I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.

3247,"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as ""pretentious crap"".  ",0
3248,"To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  ",0
3249,"One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  ",0

3365,"The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  ",0
3366,"The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.

3367,"Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  ",0
3368,I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  ,0

3373,"An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  ",1
3374,"The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  ",1
3375,"But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  ",0

3377,"Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  ",0
3378,Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  ,1
3379,"But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  ",0
3380,"I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  ",0

3479,This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  ,1
3480,"While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  ",1

3495,"Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  ",0
3496,The script is a big flawed mess.  ,0

3513,"I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  ",0
3514,"Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  ",0
3515,The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  ,1

3530,"Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  ",1
3531,"But ""Tiny Toons"" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  ",1
3532,The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  ,1
3533,"Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  ",1
3534,The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  ,1
3535,Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  ,1
3536,"Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  ",0
3537,"Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  ",0
3538,Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  ,1
3539,There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  ,0

3557,Don't miss it.  ,1
3558,"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  ",1
3559,"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  ",1
3560,"But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  ",1
3561,"It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  ",1
3562,The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  ,0
3563,"Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  ",0
3564,Avoid at all costs.  ,0

3571,"I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  ",0
3572,"He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  ",0
3573,"Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  ",1
3574,"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  ",1
3575,Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  ,1
3576,I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  ,1
3577,Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  ,1

3582,"Overall, a delight!  ",1
3583,"This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  ",0
3584,The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  ,0
3585,The least said about the acting the better.  ,0
3586,This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  ,1
3587,I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  ,1

3598,"This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  ",1
3599,"Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  ",1
3600,"However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film ""about"" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  ",1

3604,"If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  ",1
3605,It is not good.  ,0
3606,"Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  ",0
3607,Then the film just dropped the ball.  ,0
3608,This is a stunning movie.  ,1
3609,Raw and sublimely moving.  ,1
3610,"It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  ",1

3621,A good film by a great director!  ,1

3625,10 out of 10 stars.  ,1
3626,I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  ,0

3763,"It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  ",1
3764,"The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  ",1

3798,"If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  ",1
3799,"The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  ",1
3800,A film not easily forgotten.  ,1
3801,"But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  ",1
3802,The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  ,1
3803,"The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  ",1
3804,"Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  ",1

4042,Spring rolls are delicious but small.,2
4043,"Maybe I'm just fortunate, or maybe it's just that good!",2

4232,"On the plus side, the wait was much much shorter.",2
4233,No comparison.,2
4234,I'm sure I would have given them a better score had it not been for the slowness of the waiter checking on us.,2

4242,The decor is just kitchy enough to add to the authenticity without being corny.,2
4243,Way too sweet... But that seems to be the recurring theme: every single thing on the menu it seems has a sweet flavor.,2

4254,We had the Omikase -- $100 per person -- so it's a bit steep but we thought the quality was way worth it.,2
4255,"Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!",0
4256,Thought I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves with a canoli for dessert.,2

5594,For dessert they tried the mini pizookie with chocolate chunk ice cream.,2
5595,My boyfriend and I love oysters!,2
5596,I have noticed many food items out to other patrons that look delicious.,2
5597,"Uh, where were you like 20 minutes ago?",2
5598,My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.,1
5599,"I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!",1
5600,Amazing what that little bit of alcohol does to your innerchild.,2
5601,And a selection of mouth-watering cakey treats.,2
5602,Nice ambiance.,1
5603,I would recommend saving room for this!,1
5604,We arrived at 7 p.m.,2
5605,"But my favorite part is the grilled onions they bring out with the cips, salsa and bean dip.",2
5606,"Half of the table, at the recommendation of Man Vs.",2
5607,But still quite noisy.,2
5608,Especially for the price of a couple bucks per taco.,2
5609,I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.,0
5610,They basically took all the work out of eating a NY strip.,2
5611,"When I told him we would not return, he said FINE.",2
5612,"However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.",0
5613,I'm always torn about what pie to order when I come - Jack Daniels pecan?,2
5614,Hit or miss?,2
5615,This restaurant is inside the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino.,2
5616,"I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!",0
5617,AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!,0

5619,I'm kind of bringing someone their drinks.,2
5620,( tasteless).,2
5621,i am a vegan who do not like fake meat.,2
5622,We will give it another try since we live so close by.,2
5623,We never had to ask for water.,2
5624,The dish also comes with just the right amount of potatoes.,2
5625,I've had 100% better French Onion Soup at a non-French regular old diner joint than here.,2
5626,"Finally, our salads arrived.",2
5627,The place has a nice set up but the food was amiss.,2
5628,We took it to go.,2
5629,It was the size of half a rice bowl and we both looked at it like WTF.,2
5630,All of the tapas dishes were delicious!,1
5631,"Okay, enough of my rant on nutrition and on to the food.",2
5632,I had a combo of pad Thai with spring rolls.,2
5633,we got a salad that seemed to have been sitting around for a week and the pizza was terrible.,2
5634,I *heart* this place.,1
5635,"Normally when I go with another person, our bill is always under $40.",2
5636,- I forgot what it was.,2
5637,"So I was convinced this was going to be good, after reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a 4 start avg for this place.",2
5638,"My brother got the chicken strips - also salty, but at least they gave him 4 big strips.",2
5639,My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.,0
5640,Also my apologies that we graced this establishment with our presence.,2
5641,After two I felt disgusting.,0
5642,A good time!,1
5643,Our waiter David instantly took over and started making recommendations.,2
5644,It is vegetarian and vegan but I wouldn't exactly call this health food....still a healthier option than most.,2
5645,"I'll still go there because the food, drinks and service are great, but I'm wondering who else got sick?",2
5646,Actually no I wanted some clean dang tacos.,2
5647,"The structure of the tower with beams and rivets adds to the decor, and feeling of being transported.",2
5648,"It had a cool vibe to it, and cool wall hangings and lighting, so my first impression was pretty good.",2
5649,I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.,1
5650,Generous portions and great taste.,1
5651,I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!,0
5652,My guest ordered the mixed grill and I ordered the vegetable biryani as main entrees.,2
5653,"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?""",0
5654,Food was delicious!,1
5655,AN HOUR... seriously?,0
5656,"South west wrap, my sister like her wrap, but needs a hint of spice, she said.",2

5658,I consider this theft.,0
5659,My friend ordered a salad as well.,2
5660,Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.,0
5661,"Sandwich was roast beef, a top bun and a bottom bun.",2
5662,I am not being flippant.,2

5664,"The food was just as bad, but time the service was I inattentive as well.",2
5665,The cheese tasted great and the crispy/soft shell around it was very nice.,2
5666,Can't wait for one to open in Summerlin!,2
5667,Overall I have to say I enjoyed the food at the NOLA location but liked the sophisticated atmosphere and vibe of this Venetian restaurant better.,2
5668,We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.,0
5669,Waited and waited and waited.,0
5670,"Our antipasto, pizza, and molten lava cake came to about $40 without tax or tip.",2
5671,Almost like oven-roasted potatoes you'd get with a pork roast.,2
5672,"Maybe the experience would have been different if I dined in, but I won't waste my money to experiment.",2
5673,"He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.",1

5681,I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.,0
5682,FIX has warm donuts with dipping sauce on their dessert menu!,2
5683,"When I pull up to the window to get my food, the person handing me my food just stares at me.",2
5684,There were only 4 other tables in there on a Monday night.,2
5685,There are too many great Mexican restaurants in town (Javier's I'm thinking of you) to ever go back.,2
5686,Service was good and the company was better!,1
5687,30 beers on tap.,2

5690,"We asked a question, she asked the man at the bar.",2
5691,"For those of you that are not a fan of the tomato persuasion, you know how comforting it is lately to see bruschetta that does not contain tomatoes.",2
5692,There are some folks who sing great and some who don't sound anywhere close to good so you don't have to worry about not measuring up.,2
5693,"As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.",1
5694,Has it been ready that entire time but fixing the register trumped your customers?!,2
5695,"There were tables with guests all around us, and servers were actively waiting them, but no one ever came to our table.",2
5696,"Regardless of where I was in Vegas, there was always that questionable orange Hooters tempo smacking me upside the cornea.",2

5724,We saw the chinese food and it looked alright and took a chance anyway.,2
5725,OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.,1
5726,We're headed to Napa in a month and clearly we know at least one stop we'll be making.,2
5727,Add to this that my friend's nachos were wet and missing the cheese (really?),2
5728,"For breakfast - I've had the Devil's Mess - eggs, fresh veggies, chorizo and chiles and the Fresh fruit with Oatmeal and Yogurt.",2
5729,"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless.",0
5730,"And, after doing so, while I do not consider it to currently be the best steakhouse in Las Vegas, I was impressed.",2
5731,They also have a dining area separate from the bar.,2
5732,"Fries were run of the mill boring fries, and the jalapenos not spicy at all.",2
5733,Too hot to wait outside.,2
5734,I started off with a vodka and Red Bull.,2
5735,It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.,0
5736,"Given the cost and the fact I'm not going to eat a whole cow at a single sitting, I don't see this as much of a value for the $ spent.",2
5737,The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.,1
5738,For the life of me I kept thinking he said it was some sort of tongue but then after trying it I figured out it was cod.,2
5739,I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!,0
5740,It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!,1
5741,I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.,1
5742,His were slightly better than mine but not by much.,2
5743,The only redeeming point is the seafood.,2
5744,I couldn't finish because the cheese they used made me nauseous after a few bites.,2
5745,Not good for the money.,0
5746,I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!,1
5747,"We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.",0
5748,"Make no mistake, the quality and freshness are still evident here; I just don't get the Express thing.",2

5752,They also have the best cheese crisp in town.,1
5753,"Good value, great food, great service.",1
5754,Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.,1
5755,The food is good.,1

5766,!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!,0
5767,I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.,0
5768,She then turned us over to another waiter who scrambled to get proper settings.The calamari was over cooked ( dark brown and crunchy ).,2
5769,"With this platter, they also served freshly grated wasabi and freshly ground salt.",2
5770,"The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.",0
5771,"Luckily for me, I had a $75 food comp for myself and some family so all we had to shell out was a few bucks.",2

5774,An absolute must visit!,1
5775,Bread was hot.,2
5776,"And don't forget to add the fish sauce and any of the multitude of other sweet, savory, and spicy sauces and pastes, Sriracha included.",2
5777,11:55 - Finally got seated.,2
5778,It is a nice bar/ restaurant to watch sports in.,2
5779,and surely not worth the $40.00 plus a tip bill.,2
5780,"They also put an obscene amount of basil leaf on the pizza, which fortunately was not as soggy because most of it burnt up into a flaky black powder.",2
5781,"All their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom Rockefeller, a breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap.",2

5799,Twenty minutes in they called #8 and it was pretty obvious they lacked institutional restaurant control.,2
5800,Very disappointing!!!,0
5801,The first time I got the hamburger.,2
5802,The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.,1

5842,Hey maybe throw it on your burger and go Pittsburgh style!,2
5843,Ordered the deluxe skillet.,2

5846,The dough was severely under cooked to the point of the crust to be deemed officially MIA.,2
5847,Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !,1
5848,The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!,1

5859,THREE DOLLARS ON A FORTY DOLLAR ORDER!,2
5860,2 great burgers hold the mediocre fries.,2

5862,"Love the outside, great for Phoenix winters.",2
5863,We were promptly greeted and seated.,1
5864,It was a little scary to walk with a plate of food because everyone was bumping into each other.,2
5865,Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.,0

5867,"I think it's a obvious mistake, though.",2

5878,"I wanted gluten free pizza, and we were staying in PH, so we decided to grab some pizza from Lombardi's and then walk around.",2
5879,Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.,0
5880,The setting of the place is very elegant and relaxing outside but still not a reason why a small piece of fish should be so expensive,2
5881,This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.,0
5882,"To get in the restaurant, they let you wear a hospital gown to stick with the hospital theme.",2
5883,"Stop turning your nose up just cuz its at a cheesy, old hotel.",2

5887,What a mistake.,0

5891,Ate here on a Friday night about a week ago.,2
5892,My friend and I decided to order a few of their small plates as a full on meal wasn't something we were looking for at 9 PM.,2
5893,Gentle Strength moved to a new location recently and this has given them lots of room to stretch their wings.,2
5894,I mean literally flaming.,2
5895,Would have been five stars but the price to portion ratio was a little high.,2
5896,Great food.,1
5897,"A must get is the prime rib and crab legs, and for dessert cookies and gelato.",2
5898,Looks like the 4 items were sitting there for a long time.,2

5907,"Also found this place on Yelp, and Yelpers were very helpful again.",2
5908,Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.,1
5909,Peanut butter & jelly gelato!,2
5910,It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.,1
5911,Had some nefarious person stolen my dipping juice?,2
5912,I had their signature combo with 3 different types of tacos and all the items were dry.,2
5913,"I liked that they were generous with the pineapple on it though, but it tasted just like cold, canned pineapple tidbits.",2
5914,"I looked around and I thought that the décor was alright, it was a little tacky but I like to have my bars a little on the tacky side.",2
5915,"We then had an ice cream sandwich, with pistachio ice cream, the ice cream did not taste like pistachio.",2
5916,Now I have to eat salad that's not pleasant?,2
5917,"Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.",0
5918,The patio seating was very comfortable.,1
5919,We had received a gift card and were excited to use it.,2
5920,I love my steak rare but this thing came out beyond mooing... it was also very under seasoned.,2
5921,The fried rice was dry as well.,0
5922,Decoration is much nicer than other places.,2
5923,They have deals for lunch.,2
5924,"I docked a half a star since Roka is, IMHO, a tad overpriced but it is Scottsdale...",2
5925,On to Lalibela perhaps for our next Ethiopian outing!,2
5926,It was delicious though.,2
5927,"I noted that because of Scottsdale rents and having a nice decor and tablecloths, etc the prices are higher.",2
5928,And there is no other steakhouse that will serve it with the perfection it deserves.,2
5929,The Yellowtail and tomato salad were just okay.,2

6662,I also expected that they would make the extra effort for quality service and cleanliness.,2

6747,They have a decent kids menu for $6.95 and my boys got the bbq ribs and mac and cheese.,2
